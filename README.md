# covenant-finance
A program for the purpose of yearly advancement and tracking of covenant finances and advancement.

TODO:
  * Example usage
  * Add "Advance year" function
  * Front end tests
  * Cap number of covenants a user can have
  * User registration email validation
  * Cap number of income sources a covenant can have

BUGS TO FIX:
  * Login with non existant user throws error
  * Fail covenant validation throws error page
  * Fail lab validation (unique name) throws error page
  * Covenant names are currently globally unique, need to be unique per user
  * User's covenants do not populate until new login (create covenant redirect missing data)
